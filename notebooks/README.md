# AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS)
## Project Objective
This repository is dedicated to a data analysis project on historical car insurance claim data from South Africa, utilizing all four types of data analytics:

### Descriptive Analytics 
Analyzing historical data to understand patterns such as claim frequency, claim amounts, types of claims, customer demographics, and geographical patterns.

### Diagnostic Analytics
Identifying correlations between factors like driver demographics, vehicle types, geographical locations, and claim frequencies.

### Predictive Analytics
Using machine learning to predict the likelihood of future insurance claims and which customers are likely to be low-risk and high-risk.

### Prescriptive Analytics 
Recommending actionable insights based on the predictive models. This could involve suggesting specific marketing campaigns or pricing strategies tailored to low-risk target segments, or personalized offers or incentives to attract new clients from these low-risk segments.
