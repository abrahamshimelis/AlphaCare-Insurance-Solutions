## Project Overview
The project utilizes all four types of data analytics: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive. 

### Descriptive Analytics 
Analyzing historical data to understand patterns such as claim frequency, claim amounts, types of claims, customer demographics, and geographical patterns.

### Diagnostic Analytics
Identifying correlations between factors like driver demographics, vehicle types, geographical locations, and claim frequencies.

### Predictive Analytics
Using machine learning to predict the likelihood of future insurance claims and which customers are likely to be low-risk and high-risk.

### Prescriptive Analytics 
Recommending actionable insights based on the predictive models.
